     <h1>Research</h1>

  		I am predominantly devoted to statistical mechanics, especially its non-equilibrium version. Amongst currently existing approaches, I start with <b>stochastic thermodynamics(ST)</b> with applications in active matter. The aim is to describe non-equilibrium thermodynamics in terms of stochastic processes and quantify the irreversibilities using entropy production rates. At this point, I am working on my PhD project on <b>collective behaviours of pulsating active matter</b> under the supervision of <b>Dr. Etienne Fodor</b> at University of Luxembourg. Meanwhile, in collaboration with <b>Dr. Jing Yang</b> and <b>Prof. Adolfo del Campo</b>, I am working on the open quantum dynamics of <b>dissipative long-range Kitaev chain</b>.<br>

          <b>M. Res at ENS Paris</b><br>
          Before this, under the supervision of <b>Prof. Damien Laage</b> at ENS Paris, I had worked as an intern both on a full-time and a part-time basis for 3 semesters on the <b>reorientation dynamics of water molecules next to charged graphene interfaces</b>, and then did a reading internship with <b>Dr. Maria Rodriguez Martinez</b> at IBM Research Zurich on <b>deep learning interpretability</b> as my master thesis.<br>

        <b>B. Sc in Xiamen University</b><br>
          When I was an undergraduate at Xiamen University, China, I spent my after-class time working in <b>Prof. Hongping Zhu's</b> Lab. As an experimental chemist, I worked on <b>synthesis and reactivity of Ge-B <i>Frustrated Lewis Pair(FLP)</i> Compounds</b>.<br>
